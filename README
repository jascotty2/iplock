iplock - limit 1 ip address per player 

Commands: 
iplock (ipl) reload	reloads plugin configuration
iplock	reset <user>	reset (delete) ip info for this user, so they can login

- Forces players to use a static ip instead of dhcp to access their characters
- Provides an additional layer of security to prevent users breaking into admin accounts
- Can block names that are too long or contain special chars
- Can be set with a password that players can join & update their IP with
- until password is entered: 
-- can't move
-- can't break or place blocks
-- can't drop items (or pick them up)
-- monsters will ignore the player
-- invulnerable to damage
-- cannot issue server commands (like /pay user)
- Password can be entered into chat, or with /passwd
